# why budsyapp? why now?

_November 19, 2025_

## the hemp ban, cannabis education, and why budsyapp is speaking up

across the country, many people use hemp derived products to support sleep, comfort, mood, or general wellness. in many states, these options help fill gaps where medical cannabis access is limited or still developing. now that congress is discussing new restrictions on certain hemp cannabinoids, people are wondering what these changes might mean for them.

these conversations can feel confusing and overwhelming, and that is completely understandable. budsyapp is here to make cannabis education feel approachable, easy to understand, and welcoming. this is especially important during moments when laws and access may shift.

## what is happening with hemp right now

since the 2018 farm bill, hemp has been federally legal as long as it contains no more than zero point three percent delta nine thc. this opened the door for cbd, delta eight, thca flower, and other hemp derived cannabinoids that many adults use for wellness.

the new federal proposal would significantly tighten these rules. supporters say it would help reduce youth access and encourage safer, more consistent standards. critics are concerned that the language may unintentionally limit products that adults use responsibly every day. farmers, small businesses, and patients all have different perspectives, which is why the conversation feels so tense.

with so many viewpoints, it is understandable that people feel unsure about what the future holds.

## why education matters

when laws change or products become harder to understand, education becomes one of the most powerful tools we have. learning the basics helps you make choices that fit your needs, your comfort level, and your state laws.

education also plays a major role in reducing stigma. many old myths about cannabis still circulate, and honest information helps shift the conversation back toward safety, clarity, and personal wellness.

budsyapp was created to support this type of learning. we want people to feel confident, informed, and welcomed into the conversation at their own pace.

## why budsyapp? why now?

this moment is exactly why budsyapp was created. laws are shifting, access is changing, and many people feel unsure about where they fit in. budsyapp gives you a calm space to learn, reflect, and stay grounded while everything around you moves quickly. there is a lot of noise in the cannabis world right now, and our goal is to offer clarity without pressure.

by giving you simple education, a place to journal your experience, and tools that help you understand your own wellness, budsyapp helps you stay confident and informed in a time when information is needed the most.

## how budsyapp supports you

budsyapp is not here to persuade you. budsyapp is here to help you understand your own experiences and feel more secure in your choices. every feature exists to support you gently and clearly.

here is how budsyapp helps:

• **education:** simple language that explains terpenes, expected effects, and common experiences  
• **strain journal:** a calm space to write down how a product made you feel and what stood out  
• **purchase log:** an easy way to remember what you tried, where it came from, and how it worked for you  
• **many states and languages:** budsyapp is expanding so more people can learn comfortably in their own language and within their own state rules  
• **normalization through routine:** writing down your experience helps you understand your own patterns and supports positive, stigma free conversations

community organizations play an incredibly important role during moments like this. groups such as Mississippi Patient Voices work every day to support patients, share clear information, and advocate for fair access to wellness resources. their efforts help people feel seen, heard, and understood, especially when laws or policies start to shift. budsyapp is deeply grateful for the work these organizations do and hopes to continue supporting the same mission of education, clarity, and patient centered conversation.

## your voice matters

if you rely on hemp or cannabis for your wellness, it is completely valid to feel concerned or curious about these changing conversations. speaking up can help shape the future of access and education.

you can:  
• share your experience with your lawmakers  
• ask questions when something is unclear  
• advocate for patient centered and science informed policy  
• encourage calm conversations that focus on learning instead of fear  

the more we learn together, the easier it becomes to reduce stigma and support policies that improve access and safety for everyone.

budsyapp will continue expanding, improving, and creating tools that make cannabis education easier to understand. your wellness journey is personal, and we are here to support you as you learn what works best for you.
