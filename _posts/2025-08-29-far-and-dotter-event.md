On August 29th, we had a fantastic time celebrating Patient Appreciation Day at Far & Dotter in Mississippi! The event was a wonderful opportunity to connect with patients, vendors, and the local community.

Hannah represented BitPadLabs and budsyapp with a dedicated table, sharing information about the app and answering questions just before our official launch. It was a great chance to introduce budsyapp to new users and gather valuable feedback from the community.

We want to give a huge shoutout to Sederia, Jennifer, and the entire Far & Dotter crew for hosting such a welcoming and well-organized event. Special thanks to all the vendors and patients who stopped by to say hello:

- Far & Dotter Mississippi
- Keen Cannabis
- Noble Labs
- Borneo Bud
- Budsyapp
- The Honey Brew
- TopDawgz

Thank you to everyone who made the day memorable! We look forward to more events and opportunities to connect with the community as we continue to grow budsyapp.

â€” The BitPadLabs Team
