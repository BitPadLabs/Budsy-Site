# Stashbox Makeover! 🎨✨

We gave our stashbox a fresh new look with some awesome stickers from our favorite brands! 🧑‍🎨🪩

## Why a Stashbox Makeover?

Stashboxes are more than just a place to keep your essentials; they're a reflection of our community, creativity, and the stories we share. Adding new stickers is our way of celebrating the amazing connections we've made and the brands that inspire us. 💚

## Shoutout to the Community 🙌

Thank you to everyone who has shared stickers, stories, and good vibes with us! Your support keeps us inspired to keep growing and learning together. If you spot your sticker on our stashbox, let us know! We love seeing our community represented. 🌱

## Want to Join In?

Have a favorite sticker or brand you'd like to see on our stashbox? Drop us a message or bring one to our next event! Let's keep building this collection together.
