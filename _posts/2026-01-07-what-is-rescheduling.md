# what is rescheduling?

# cannabis rescheduling to schedule iii: what’s happened, what hasn’t, and what comes next (with examples)

*last updated: january 7, 2026*  
*education only. not legal advice.*

there’s a lot of noise around “rescheduling,” so this post is meant to be a clear, step-by-step roadmap that matches what has actually happened so far, including the dates.

rescheduling is the federal process of moving a substance between schedules under the controlled substances act (csa). the current proposal would move marijuana from schedule i to schedule iii. that would be a major policy shift, but it is not the same thing as legalization.

## quick definitions

### rescheduling vs legalization vs descheduling
- **rescheduling**: moving marijuana to a different schedule under the csa  
- **legalization**: creating a lawful framework for adult-use or broad federal legality  
- **descheduling**: removing marijuana from the csa schedules entirely

---

## glossary
- **csa**: controlled substances act  
- **hhs**: department of health and human services  
- **fda**: food and drug administration  
- **dea**: drug enforcement administration  
- **doj**: department of justice  
- **nprm**: notice of proposed rulemaking  
- **alj**: administrative law judge  
- **280e**: irs tax provision limiting deductions for certain controlled-substance activity

---

### what schedule iii means (and what it doesn’t)
schedule iii substances are still **controlled**. in simple terms, it signals the government views the substance as having recognized medical use within the csa framework and lower abuse potential than schedule i or ii.

important note: schedule iii status does **not** automatically convert state cannabis programs into federal pharmacy-style systems. federal drug frameworks typically revolve around fda pathways and prescriptions, and state programs are built differently.

## the timeline so far (what has happened, with dates)

### 1 - the federal review was initiated (october 6, 2022) ✅
president biden publicly directed the secretary of hhs and the attorney general to begin a review of how marijuana is scheduled under federal law.

**real-world example:**  
this is the moment the federal “re-evaluation” officially kicked off and agencies started building the record.

### 2 - hhs completed its scientific and medical review and recommended schedule iii (august 29, 2023) ✅
hhs sent dea a formal recommendation that marijuana should be placed into schedule iii, based on the required medical and scientific evaluation.

**real-world example:**  
think of this as the “science file” that helps inform the rest of the process.

### 3 - doj/dea moved the process into formal rulemaking (may 2024) ✅
the justice department submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking (nprm), which is the official rulemaking mechanism that starts the public regulatory process.

**key point:**  
this is still a proposal stage. until a final rule is published, federal scheduling does not change.

**real-world example:**  
this is the stage where you begin seeing the official proposal discussed in terms of the federal register, public comments, and administrative procedure.

### 4 - public comments were collected and the comment period ended (july 22, 2024) ✅
the comment window closed on july 22, 2024. those comments become part of the official record that dea must consider.

**real-world example:**  
patients, clinicians, advocacy organizations, researchers, and industry groups submit comments describing impacts, concerns, and what they want clarified.

### 5 - dea announced a hearing process, then the merits hearing was cancelled and the case stayed (january 2025) ✅ / ⏸️
the merits hearing was scheduled to begin january 21, 2025, but the administrative law judge cancelled the hearing and stayed the proceedings due to an interlocutory appeal.

short version: the process hit a procedural roadblock.

### 6 - the rescheduling matter remained in a stay status (july 23, 2025 notice) ⏸️
in a notice to the parties dated july 23, 2025, the presiding administrative law judge stated the case was still in a stay status pending resolution of the interlocutory appeal.

### 7 - executive action directed agencies to expedite completion of the process (december 18, 2025) ✅
an executive order directed the attorney general to take steps to complete the rulemaking process related to rescheduling marijuana to schedule iii as expeditiously as allowed by law.

**important clarification:**  
this executive order directs action. it does not, by itself, publish a final rule or flip the schedule overnight.

## where things stand right now (as of january 7, 2026)
we are past the “science review” and “proposal” stages, and past the initial comment period.

the biggest open items are:
- whether and how the stayed proceeding is resolved procedurally (the appeal/stay issue)
- whether a hearing phase resumes or is otherwise addressed
- whether dea issues a final rule, modifies the proposal, or withdraws it

as of this update, marijuana is still treated as a schedule i substance federally unless and until a final rule is published and becomes effective.

## what has not happened yet

### final rule published in the federal register ❌
this is the moment a proposal becomes an actual regulatory change, with an effective date.

### implementation phase ❌
after a final rule, agencies, states, and regulated industries have to interpret and operationalize changes. that is where practical impacts become clearer.

### post-final court challenges (if any) ❌
lawsuits can follow final agency action and can affect timelines.

## what schedule iii could change

### research could become easier to run
schedule iii generally has fewer research barriers than schedule i. that does not mean “no red tape,” but it can reduce friction.

**example:**  
a university team studying pain, nausea, or appetite issues may face fewer scheduling hurdles compared to schedule i research protocols.

### taxes for state-legal cannabis businesses could shift (280e)
one of the biggest practical talking points is irs code 280e, which limits deductions for businesses dealing in schedule i or ii substances. moving to schedule iii is widely discussed as changing how 280e applies.

**example:**  
a dispensary may be able to deduct more normal business expenses if 280e no longer applies.

### it still does not equal federal legalization
schedule iii would still be a controlled status. state programs do not automatically become federally authorized businesses just because the schedule changes.

**example:**  
you could still see conflicts between federal rules and state-legal operations unless congress passes broader reforms.

## myth checks

### myth: “schedule iii means dispensaries become pharmacies”
not automatically.

### myth: “rescheduling means cannabis is federally legal”
no. it is a classification change, not full legalization.

### myth: “everything changes immediately”
no. the legal status does not change until a final rule is published and effective, and implementation takes time even after that.
